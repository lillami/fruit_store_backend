# fruit_store_backend
for my final exam

1. changeImage.py:transforming and converting images

2. supplier_image_upload.py: takes the jpeg images from the __supplier-data/images directory__ processed previously and uploads them to the __web server fruit catalog__

3. run.py: 
To add fruit images and their descriptions from the supplier on the fruit catalog web-server,
create a new Python script that will automatically POST the fruit images and
their respective description in JSON format.

to process the text files (001.txt, 003.txt ...) from the __supplier-data/descriptions directory__.
The script should turn the data into a JSON dictionary by adding all the required fields,
including the image associated with the fruit (image_name), and uploading it to
__http://[external-IP]/fruits__ using the Python requests library.
